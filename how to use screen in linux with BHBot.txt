Use this to run bot under linux:
screen -d -m -S bhbot  # creates a detached screen session with name "bhbot"
screen -r bhbot # reattaches bhbot screen session

to detach (while inside a screen), press "ctrl-a, d"

to resume detached process, use: screen -r

to send data to stdin of the screen (examples):
screen -S bhbot -p 0 -X stuff "reload^M"
screen -S bhbot -p 0 -X stuff "reload$(printf \\r)"

From man:
-d -m
   Start screen in "detached" mode. This creates a new session but doesn't
   attach to it.  This is useful for system startup scripts.
-S sessionname
   When creating a new session, this option can be used to specify a meaningful
   name for the session.
-X
   Send the specified command to a running screen session e.g. stuff.
