# pvpstrip command example: "pvpstrip b r". General syntax: "pvpstrip [m|o|b|r|h|n]*". Individual letters denote equipment type to be stipped down (m=mainhand, o=offhand, b=body, r=ring, h=head, n=neck). Note however that stripping off mainhand makes no sense. You should strip down other parts of your body!
# in case you don't want to strip down for PvP, just delete this command!

# raids list format is as follows: "a b c", where a=[1|2], b=[1|2|3], c=[0..100], and 'a' is raid type (1 or 2), 'b' is difficulty (1=normal, 2=hard, 3=heroic), 'c' is probability of this type to be selected

# if autoconsume is 1 (enabled), then bot will automatically consume consumables defined by 'consumables' string
autoconsume 0
# the 'consumables' string defines consumables (separated by spaces) that should be always in use. If they are not, bot will attempt to consume them (if case they are found in the inventory).
# Example: "consumables exp_minor item_major gold_average". This will make sure those 3 consumables are always in use (bot will automatically consume them once the are exhausted).
# Possible consumable types are: exp_*, item_*, speed_* and gold_* (where * is one of the minor, average or major).
